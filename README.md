# Silent's Gems: Extra Parts

Adds additional parts and materials to Silent's Gems.

### Future Plans

Extra Parts will no longer be needed in 1.13+, as Silent Gear - which replaces the tool system in Gems - will allow new materials to be added with simple data packs (if all goes according to plan). Support for 1.12.2 will continue for now, at least bug fixes.
